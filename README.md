# GEngine

Actually a library because the UI will probably look 15 years old and there will be more than one editor........

Still in development, any help is appreciated.

# Goals from BIG-BIG-BIG to less important

1. Completely deterministic unless the user messes up.

2. Fixing an issue with float where rendering gets distorted the higher your coordenates are. (this will be done by calculating the final rendering position with the camera before casting to float)

3. A built-in... FREE multiple server hosting system so you can host more than one server in the same port. (in case somehow you want to host a 2d MMO in this, i don't think you should... but hey, let's that easier, it might be good for someone with a inovative idea... and not an MMO)

4. Prefab-like system.

5. No goddam encapsulation. (it's bad for memory usage and C# GC is bad)

6. Bearable performance.

7. Editor(s).

8. Fix my own mistakes. (i know, it's hard, but this rendering system is making me question myself as a programmer, it allocates way too much memory)

9. All is free. (probably will have donation page if people actually become interested in this project)
